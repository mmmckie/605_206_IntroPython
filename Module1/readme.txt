Module Info: Module 1 Assignment: Hello World! Due on 08/31/2025 at 11:59 EST

Approach: 

hello.py - I created a variable called "name" and called the input() function
to prompt the user to type in their name. I used "Joe" for the input to align
with the assignment example. I then used the "+" operator to concatenate the
words "Hello" with the input and "!" to form the final output string, and used
the print() function to print this output.


due_date.py - Using the same method from the hello.py program, I prompted the
user to input values for month, day, year, hours, minutes, and seconds. I then
concatenated all of these values into a single output string to give the Module
1 Assignment due date again using the "+" operator and printed this final output
with the print() function.
